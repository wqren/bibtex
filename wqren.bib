   pages = {1794-1801},
   abstract = {Recently SVMs using spatial pyramid matching (SPM) kernel have been highly successful in image classification. Despite its popularity, these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n<sup>2</sup> ~ n<sup>3</sup>) in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the training size, implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle more than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel on histograms, and is even better than the nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hierarchical sparse coding model based on local image descriptors for classification tasks. The supervised dictionary training is performed via back-projection, by minimizing the training error of classifying the image level features, which are extracted by max pooling over the sparse codes within a spatial pyramid. Such a max pooling procedure across multiple spatial scales offer the model translation invariant properties, similar to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments show that our supervised dictionary improves the performance of the proposed model significantly over the unsupervised dictionary, leading to state-of-the-art performance on diverse image databases. Further more, our supervised model targets learning linear features, implying its great potential in handling large scale datasets in real applications.},

   abstract = {The traditional SPM approach based on bag-of-features (BoF) requires nonlinear classifiers to achieve good image classification performance. This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K<sup>2</sup>). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications.},

   abstract = {We present a method for learning image representations using a two-layer sparse coding scheme at the pixel level. The first layer encodes local patches of an image. After pooling within local regions, the first layer codes are then passed to the second layer, which jointly encodes signals from the region. Unlike traditional sparse coding methods that encode local patches independently, this approach accounts for high-order dependency among patterns in a local image neighborhood. We develop algorithms for data encoding and codebook learning, and show in experiments that the method leads to more invariant and discriminative image representations. The algorithm gives excellent results for hand-written digit recognition on MNIST and object recognition on the Caltech101 benchmark. This marks the first time that such accuracies have been achieved using automatically learned features from the pixel level, rather than using hand-designed descriptors.},

    abstract = {{Several example-based systems for shape retrieval  and shape classification directly match input shapes to  stored shapes, without using class membership  information to perform the matching. We propose a  method for improving the accuracy of this type of  system. First, the system learns a set of chance  probability functions (CPFs). The CPFs estimate the  probabilities of obtaining a query shape with  particular distances from each training example by  chance. The learned CPFs are used at runtime to  rapidly estimate the chance probabilities of the  observed distances between the actual query shape and  the database shapes. These estimated probabilities are  then used as a dissimilarity measure for shape  retrieval and/or nearest-neighbor classification. The  CPF learning method is parameter-free. Experimental  evaluation demonstrates that: (1) chance probabilities  yield higher accuracy than Euclidean distances; (2) the  learned CPFs support fast matching; and (3) the CPF-based  system outperforms prior systems on a standard  benchmark test of retrieval accuracy.}},

   abstract = {Most research efforts on image classification so far have been focused on medium-scale datasets, which are often defined as datasets that can fit into the memory of a desktop (typically 4G~48G). There are two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training data and converges very fast-typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate.},
