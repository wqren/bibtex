	highly successful in image classification. Despite its popularity,
	these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n<sup>2</sup> ~ n<sup>3</sup>)
	in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the training size, implying
	that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle more than
	thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension
	of the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse
	coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a
	linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably
	reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant
	in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find
	that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM
	based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms
	the linear SPM kernel on histograms, and is even better than the
	nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art performance on
	several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors.},

	This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained
	Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM.
	LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor
	into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are
	integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With
	linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better
	than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance
	on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22],
	the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In
	addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first
	performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained
	least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of
	O(M + K<sup>2</sup>). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system
	can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly
	adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications.},

	for high-order dependency among patterns in a local image neighborhood.
	We develop algorithms for data encoding and codebook learning, and
	show in experiments that the method leads to more invariant and discriminative
	image representations. The algorithm gives excellent results for

	directly match input shapes to stored shapes, without using class

	learns a set of chance probability functions (CPFs). The CPFs estimate
	the probabilities of obtaining a query shape with particular distances
	from each training example by chance. The learned CPFs are used at
	runtime to rapidly estimate the chance probabilities of the observed
	distances between the actual query shape and the database shapes.
	These estimated probabilities are then used as a dissimilarity measure
	for shape retrieval and/or nearest-neighbor classification. The CPF
	learning method is parameter-free. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
	that: (1) chance probabilities yield higher accuracy than Euclidean
	distances; (2) the learned CPFs support fast matching; and (3) the
	CPF-based system outperforms prior systems on a standard benchmark
	test of retrieval accuracy.}},

  abstract = {Most research efforts on image classification so far have been focused
	on medium-scale datasets, which are often defined as datasets that
	can fit into the memory of a desktop (typically 4G~48G). There are
	two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification.
	First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost
	no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification.
	This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second,
	large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges
	than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve
	efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without
	compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this
	challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction,
	we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel
	using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated
	features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million
	images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging
	stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all
	1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing
	with terabytes of training data and converges very fast-typically
	5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art
	performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9%
	in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate.},

	abundance of images. {H}owever, the knowledge will be useless if
	one can't _nd it. {I}n the face of the substantive and increasing
	apace images, how to search and to retrieve the images that we interested
	with facility is a fatal problem: it brings a necessity for image
	retrieval systems. {A}s we know, visual features of the images provide
	a description of their content. {C}ontent-based image retrieval ({CBIR}),
	emerged as a promising mean for retrieving images and browsing large
	images databases. {CBIR} has been a topic of intensive research in
	recent years. {I}t is the process of retrieving images from a collection
